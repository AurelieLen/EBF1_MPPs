* How to use
To reproduce the analysis presented in the paper:

1. After cloning this repository enter the scRNASeq directory:

~cd scRNASeq~

1. Download the container from: *LINK* (rpyv4)

2. Modify the container variable in the run_analysis.sh script to point to the singularity image

3. Download the data from: *LINK*, uncompress and move to the subdirectory: data/

4. Run the analysis:

~./run_analysis.sh~

This script will create several directories to hold output files from respective analysis script, e.g. figures or processed data.
